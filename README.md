# Chess
Player vs player chess that does not allow illegal moves

Buttons: Undo (go to previous move) = z, Reset game = r

Jester Mode: The knight transforms into the piece that it takes. Once the knight takes that piece they just become that piece. They are not special (they can't transform again). To change to jester mode go to line 283 in chessEngine.py and change isJester to True
